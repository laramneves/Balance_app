# Balance_project

The Balance Project was my last project with three other colleagues at the bootcamp Code for All_. It was a 24-hour Hackathon with several groups. All the projects were based on songs, and ours was "Toxicity" by System of a Down. <p>
This project represents two sides, one that is toxic, and the other that is the opposite. That's the reason why the name of the project is Balance, because we need to find a balance between both sides.
